The goal is to build a Tensor-based computer graphics library that focuses on the field of computer vision.

The graphic elements of this project refer to the **Canvas** of tkinter (Python 3.7 or later). The code implementation principle and the instruction manual can refer to [tutorial](https://github.com/TensorAtom/tutorial/tree/master/Graph/README.md) in this project.

Graph_tensor user manual reference [manual](manual.md).

## PyPI support available

You can install the latest version using the following command:

```sh
$ pip install graph-tensor
```

The following command is used when called:

```python
import graph_tensor
```
